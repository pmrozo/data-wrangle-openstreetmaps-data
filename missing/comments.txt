Thank You for feedback Nikolay

Here I put two files that were used to build db.
First one is named: dataCleaningAndConversion.py
During parsing I look twotags and checked values. If there is someting I need to fix then I do it, otherwise I omit faulty record as wrong one. (I could also fix the data or simply delete it, but after visualization I took decision to delete it, since there are literally few records with unclean data, so no loss for general ide having ~400k of records.

Second file is dbinsert.py  and simply inserts json file into mongoDb using json library.

I hope this was the missing data and that You are satisfied. 

Currently I am focusing on third project in R.
